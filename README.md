## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### Screenshots

I took screenshots without the footer because it was with position fixed and it was a little bit strange when I took screenshots of the full page. Also I didn't took with all of the examples on every single device size.

### What I learned

*Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.*

With this project I started to work with API, in this case with Rest Country API and that means that I needed to use data fetching with fetch. Also I needed to understand how redux toolkit manages this fetchs with the extra Reducers and work with asynchronous things, something that I had never worked with directly.

### Continued development

Of course, I'm still confused a lot about the asynchrony and that is something that I need to still studying.

### Useful resources

- [Lodash Chunk](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#chunk) - This helped me to separate an array into chunks of 'x' items.
- [Numbers](https://linuxhint.com/add-commas-number-javascript/#:~:text=JavaScript%20provides%20toLocaleString()%2C%20regex,a%20comma%20after%20the%20digit.) - This helped me to put automatically commas in the specifics parts of a number to make it more readable.
